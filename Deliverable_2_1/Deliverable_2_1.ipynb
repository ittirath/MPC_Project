    "## Deliverable 2.1 — Why the Linearized Rocket System Splits Into Four Independent Subsystems\n",
    "\n",
    "Around the hover equilibrium, the rocket behaves like a *weakly coupled*, almost *block-diagonal* mechanical system. This occurs because each actuator influences a distinct physical direction of motion, and the rocket’s symmetry causes most cross-couplings to vanish when linearized.\n",

    "- **δ₁** produces horizontal force mainly in **y**,\n",
    "- **Pavg** changes only vertical thrust,\n",
    "- **Pdiff** creates a pure torque about the body-z axis.\n",

    "In the linearized model, the dynamics of the four motion channels (x, y, z, and roll) become decoupled at first order because all cross-coupling terms vanish at the hover equilibrium. As a result, the A matrix becomes block-diagonal after reordering the states, while the B matrix exhibits a block-column structure, where each input affects only the states of its corresponding subsystem.\n",

    "### 5. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "At hover, the rocket’s thrust vectoring geometry, its axial symmetry, and the zero nominal attitude combine to make the linearized dynamics naturally decouple into four independent channels. Each control input impacts only one physical mode at first order, and the spacecraft’s symmetry eliminates the remaining couplings. As a result, the linearized model splits cleanly into the four SISO subsystems (x, y, z, roll), each of which can be controlled independently.\n"
